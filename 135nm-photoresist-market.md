<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 13.5nm Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry 13.5nm Photoresist</li><li>Liquid 13.5nm Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dry 13.5nm photoresist refers to a type of photoresist that is applied in a dry form to the substrate, followed by a heating process to remove any solvent and initiate the photoresist's chemical reactions. On the other hand, liquid 13.5nm photoresist is applied in liquid form directly onto the substrate and typically requires a drying process to remove any solvent before further processing. Both types of photoresist offer different advantages and are utilized in various semiconductor manufacturing processes.</p></p>
