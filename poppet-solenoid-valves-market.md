<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poppet Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally-closed</li><li>Normally open</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Poppet solenoid valves come in two main types: normally-closed and normally-open. Normally-closed valves are closed by default and open when an electrical current is applied, making them suitable for applications requiring emergency shut-off or safety measures. On the other hand, normally-open valves are open by default and close when an electrical signal is sent, making them ideal for tasks such as regulating flow or releasing pressure. Both types cater to specific market needs and play essential roles in various industries.</p></p>
