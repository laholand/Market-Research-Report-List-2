<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Virtual Drug Screening System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully-Autonomous</li><li>Semi-Autonomous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The virtual drug screening system market is divided into two main types: fully-autonomous and semi-autonomous. Fully-autonomous systems operate independently and require minimal human intervention, providing a hands-off approach to drug screening. On the other hand, semi-autonomous systems involve some level of human control and decision-making in the drug screening process. Both types offer efficient and effective ways to conduct virtual drug screening, with fully-autonomous systems being more automated and self-sufficient, while semi-autonomous systems allow for more flexibility and human oversight.</p></p>
