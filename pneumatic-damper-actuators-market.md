<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pneumatic damper actuators are widely used in HVAC systems for controlling airflow in ducts. Spring return damper actuators use a spring to return the damper to its default position when the control signal is removed. On the other hand, non-spring return damper actuators do not have a spring and rely on external forces to return the damper to its default position. Both types of actuators offer precise control over airflow and play a crucial role in maintaining optimal indoor air quality and comfort.</p></p>
