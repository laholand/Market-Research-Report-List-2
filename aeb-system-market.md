<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AEB System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward Collision Warning</li><li>Dynamic Brake Support</li><li>Crash Imminent Braking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AEB system market is divided into three main types: Forward Collision Warning, Dynamic Brake Support, and Crash Imminent Braking. Forward Collision Warning alerts the driver of an impending collision, allowing them to take evasive action. Dynamic Brake Support provides additional braking assistance to help the driver avoid a collision or reduce the severity of impact. Crash Imminent Braking automatically applies the brakes if a collision is imminent and the driver does not react in time, potentially preventing a crash or reducing its severity.</p></p>
